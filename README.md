### Hi there,

I am a programmer interested in machine learning, data science, and software engineering.

## Current Projects:
- Custom MNIST: Create and train a neural network without using a machine learning framework, such as TensorFlow or Pytorch. This will require me to manually implement backpropagation.

## Completed Projects:
- [US Medical Insurance Costs](https://github.com/nelsen129/us-medical-insurance-costs): A series of regressions on several variables, such as age and BMI, and the resulting insurance costs. I performed several simple regressions and implemented gradient descent for multiple regressions.

## Currently Learning:
