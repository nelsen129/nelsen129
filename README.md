### Hi there,

I am a programmer interested in DevOps, AWS, and learning how to work more effectively

## Current Projects:
- [Advent of Code 2022 in Go](https://github.com/nelsen129/adventofcode-2022-go): Solving the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in Golang.
- [Terraform AWS Deployment](https://github.com/nelsen129/terraform-aws-deployment): An experiment in deploying AWS infrastructure from GitHub Actions using Terraform. It can deploy a WordPress instance to both prod and dev accounts depending on the commit event in GitHub.

## Completed Projects:
- [MNIST From Scratch](https://github.com/nelsen129/mnist-from-scratch): A neural network created and trained without using a machine learning framework, such as TensorFlow or Pytorch, requiring a manual implementation of data processing, network creation, and backpropagation.
- [US Medical Insurance Costs](https://github.com/nelsen129/us-medical-insurance-costs): A series of regressions on several variables, such as age and BMI, and the resulting insurance costs. I performed several simple regressions and implemented gradient descent for multiple regressions.
